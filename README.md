<h1> About me</h1>
<p> I am a Front-end software and web developer with a non-traditional background in music. 

While music has been the focus of life since school, my musical success is a positive side-effect of my true passion. Iâ€™ve found that my professional life has been driven by an intellectual curiosity for all things, and the commitment towards constant self-improvement.

Qualities that define me are my positive moral character, strong work ethic, critical thinking, problem solving skills, and a focused, yet lighthearted approach to work. You can rest easy knowing that I will be a calming, positive, and enjoyable addition to your team! </p>
