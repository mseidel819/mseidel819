<h1> About me</h1>
<p> I am a Front-end software and web developer with a non-traditional background in music. I have 1 year of professional experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte, and React.js. Skilled in building responsive and user-friendly web applications using Material-UI and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Possess strong communication and emotional intelligence skills, enabling effective collaboration with cross-functional teams. Committed to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies through continuing education. Proficient in Git for version control and project management.

While music has been the focus of life since school, my musical success is a positive side-effect of my true passion. Iâ€™ve found that my professional life has been driven by an intellectual curiosity for all things, and the commitment towards constant self-improvement.

Qualities that define me are my positive moral character, strong work ethic, critical thinking, problem solving skills, and a focused, yet lighthearted approach to work. You can rest easy knowing that I will be a calming, positive, and enjoyable addition to your team! </p>
