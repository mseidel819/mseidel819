<h1> About me</h1>
<p> Matt graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University in 2012 with a double major in music and philosophy. He got his masterâ€™s degree in trombone performance at Southern Illinois University in 2015.

While music has been the focus of Mattâ€™s life since school, his musical success is a positive side-effect of his true passion. Matt's professional life is driven by intellectual curiosity for all things, and the commitment towards constant self-improvement. This can be most directly seen through consistent participation in continuing education courses throughout the years. Examples of these courses include weeklong instrument repair clinics anytime they are available, college courses at heartland community college, and programming courses on Udemy.com.

Qualities that define Matt are his positive moral character, strong work ethic, critical thinking, problem solving skills, and his focused, yet lighthearted approach to work. You can rest easy knowing that Matt will be a calming, positive, and enjoyable addition to your team! </p>
